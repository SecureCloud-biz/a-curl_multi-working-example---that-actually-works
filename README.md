StackOverflow and PHP.net are filled with half-a$$ examples from more than 5 years ago, some result with a long CPU hang time, some simply do not work due to "reasons", THIS ONE WORKS - provide an end result of an array, filled with all of the headers (in the orders appeared, including 30x redirections) the content of the page or resource (raw) - double as much urls you would like to use, resources are cleaned properly and handlers are closed when possible to save memory
